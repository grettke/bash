-   Search for learning resources
    -   Googled &ldquo;advanced bash&rdquo;, went through first two pages of results and
        selected &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; resources

            that were novel or 2015+
        -   Days later revised my search results to: Kindle, 4=stars+ on them and
            this one won with 5/5 stars of 20 reviews. I was looking for 2015
            or newest possible because I wanted Bash 4.2 covered; it added arrays.
            All years of books are probably valuable; I&rsquo;m trying to save time by
            getting everything in one. Might be possible, might not; and I will try.

                    -   Classic, wow
            -   That got me thinking about asking the question
                -   Do I want to learn Bash well? Do I want to learn scripting and system
                    administration well? First, I want to learn Bash well, so I will focus
                    on a Bash scripting book. This is for system admnistration in the form
                    of DevOps, so I will pursue it in that order.
                -   Is this realistic or possible? Starting to narrow it down. Thus far
                    I&rsquo;ve only read review and the title/cover. Reading the blurbs now.
                    -   **+A:** real world, perfect.
                    -   **+D:** mentions zsh, security, and more, didn&rsquo;t want a reference now,
                        and this seems to have everything
                    -   **+E:** Doesn&rsquo;t bloviate, all aspects, wow
                    -   **-B:** seems like a great reference/introduction (refintroduction?)
                        and not something I want given I want Bash stuff this also seems
                        too introductory
                    -   **-C:** mention Vi and deleting files, too basic
                -   Down to 3: A, D, E
                    -   Only want one. Need to scope this somehow.
                    -   Never conidered how much I suck at sysadmin&rsquo;ing, yikes I mean I can
                        make it happen, not too badly, but I never read a single document
                        on &ldquo;being a sysadmin. Maybe it doesn&rsquo;t matter?
                    -   E is out, for the future, scope just too big
                -   Down to 2: A, E
                    -   Review again
                        -   **D:** Sysadmin stuff. Same as devops.
                        -   **A:** says all the right things, develop a GUI with bash, but doesn&rsquo;t
                            get to Shell scripting until part 2 in chapter **11**, signal
                            handling is nice never touched that, advanced scipting doesn&rsquo;t
                            seem that advanced. Book has tone of sysadmin stuff, or if you
                            never used UNIX before. 3 chapters of example scripts that is
                            cool. First half of the book might skip.
                    -   Thoughts
                        -   Both are great books for different reasons
                        -   Perhaps I should get both?
                        -   Reviewed the TOCs again remembering the goal
                            -   A - Ch 1: overview. Everything else examples. Expect, can I use
                                expect to answer prompts for stuff? I should learn Expect. Might
                                not even need something like Monit if it is this simple. Sweet,
                                sweet stuff.
                            -   B - Lookg introductory, but not, all useful stuff, might upt
                                documentation together in mind
                            -   C - basics
                            -   D - shouldl ike it, but don&rsquo;t
                                E - awesome, too much
                        -   Thoughts
                            -   Screwed up lettering, that was a bad idea
                            -   Both A and B look good, B leans more towards an overview thing,
                                which is what I wanted in addition to the reference manual.
                                I&rsquo;ll start there, bought it.

## Decision

    ID: B1375392-9E85-4844-B891-E1E4532E6EEA

-   Read the user manual
    -   It exists for a reason
-   Read one other resource
    -   Provides another perspective, and voice
    -   Balance speed with detail

### Index

    ID: 004E3AAD-6755-4A8C-8B0D-D304E139368B

-   Started [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/index.html)
-   TOC looks great: basics, quoting and commands, parms, expansion, redirection,
    bultins, variables, features of the language, job control
-   Written version 4.3
-   Each section notes other shells that inspired `bash` features and those unique
    to `bash`

### 1 Introduction

    ID: C770AAA4-9CFE-4963-9580-A7833D98B18D

1.  1.1 What is Bash?

        ID: 319AC703-D580-408D-B601-DF6096C86F2C

    -   &ldquo;Command language interpreter&rdquo; is not synomymous with &ldquo;shell&rdquo;, but it is
        critical to it&rsquo;s function
    -   `bash` is the first programming language that I &ldquo;learned&rdquo;
    -   `bash` is the default shell for GNU

2.  1.2 What is a shell?

        ID: 32D5F6A7-54AB-49BA-8EE9-8646FEA4E0F3

    -   A shell is a macro processor that executes commands
    -   A macro processor expands text and symbols to create new expressions
    -   Is both a command interpreter and programming language
    -   Key point is that newly-creates scripts that use existing commands become
        first-class commands as far as the OS is concerned. Make me think of Scheme
        where language **didn't** let you do so!
    -   Interactive, or not
    -   Synchronous, or asynchrnous command execution
    -   Easily control environment in which commands execute
        -   Already feeling excited about learning `bash`
    -   Programming features: Variables, flow control, quoting, and functions; great
    -   Interactive features: job control, command line editing, command history,
        and aliases

### 2 Definitions

    ID: 8F95FFED-E20E-40F6-BBFB-223432F853C3

-   `POSIX`, does it have a place any more?
-   `control operator` is an important concept (definition)
-   `exit status` is 8 bits (255 values)
-   `field` is a unit of text that is the result of a shell expansion
-   `job` is a pipline any of it&rsquo;s child processes
-   `job control` is a way to start, suspend, resume or stop processes
-   `name` is synonymous with `identifier`
-   `signal` is a notification from the kernel of a system level event

### 3 Basic Shell Features

    ID: 8AF90632-57CB-473C-B8B5-9F874CAB3147

-   Evaluation and quoting are taken from the standard

1.  3.1 Shell Syntax

        ID: A016192D-76B2-4B9B-88FC-F8614047564E

    -   No comment

2.  3.1.1 Shell Operation

        ID: 3B1DE1E8-C252-4A4C-8C38-1FCCAD757F88

    -   `-c` runs code as an argument
    -   Explains program flow in 7 steps

3.  3.1.2 Quoting

        ID: 683EC56D-694E-41FC-8236-CEBAE6573370

    -   It&rsquo;s appearance so early in the documentation reveals it&rsquo;s importance!

4.  3.1.2.1 Escape Character

        ID: 8E13D789-047D-46A4-9F6D-D17B825F49E4

    -   `\` is the Bash escape character
        -   escapes the next single character
            -   Exception being `\newline`

5.  3.1.2.2 Single Quotes

        ID: 098BBAB6-68F9-447A-840F-79006F77DE91

    -   Preserve the literal value of each character
    -   A single quote can&rsquo;t appear here; even when escaped!

6.  3.1.2.3 Double Quotes

        ID: FEE888CD-AFD9-4612-BABF-1E361CDFC434

    -   Preserve the literal value of everything but special characters
        -   So, expansion can be disabled
    -   `$`, `` ` ``, `\` are the special expansion characters
        -   `!` when history expansion is enabled

7.  3.1.2.4 ANSI-C Quoting

        ID: DD23D5B8-E671-43C1-BD33-01FCC5303783

    -   Good to know
    -   Is Unicode supported by Bash?

8.  3.1.2.5 Locale-Specific Translation

        ID: 71103096-FF29-40E7-88B0-06146763AA24

    -   `$` expansions are locale-specific
        -   They aren&rsquo;t covered yet this far in the manual

9.  3.1.3 Comments

        ID: BEF1FC63-328C-4824-BF93-9DF7C9BB6170

    -   `Shopt` builtin lets you disable comments entirely
    -   `#` comments out a line

10. 3.2 Shell Commands

        ID: 8A2313AF-A79B-4557-95AE-609504A805DE

    -   Covers how the command shells processes commands
        -   Should have read this in 1995

11. 3.2.1 Simple Commands

        ID: 7812D66C-8EA5-4D77-AC4F-C0D09949580A

    -   A command is a program and it&rsquo;s arguments

12. 3.2.2 Pipelines

        ID: 572EC419-1357-44DB-B6C4-F8ABAF799923

    -   `Pipelining` means taking the result of one command and passing it to another as
        input via a pipe
    -   Can redirect the standard error output as additional input to the next
        command
        -   Shorthand is `2>&1` which enables it for any following commands
    -   Explains why `time` is a builtin; difficult to do with an external
    -   Each command is executed in a subshell
    -   Enable short-circuit pipline evaluation with `pipefail`

13. 3.2.3 Lists of Commands

        ID: AA9E82E2-2095-4672-8BB2-3377B86556A7

    -   `&` makes commands run asynchronously
    -   `;` makes commands run synchronously
    -   `&&` and `||` are `AND` and `OR` for commands

14. 3.2.4 Compound Commands

        ID: 1E11088A-1E48-4736-94B2-D3AAE6D6CF86

    -   Mentions that you don&rsquo;t have to end grouped commands with `;`, but it might be
        helpful

15. 3.2.4.1 Looping Constructs

        ID: E4AC652C-F353-45E7-9C74-91028470E272

    -   until
        -   until test; do stuff; done
    -   while
        -   while test; do stuff; done
    -   for name [ [ in [words &#x2026;] ] ; do stuff; done
        -   Expand words, and execute stuff for each member of the resulting list, with
            value bound to name
        -   Can also do
            -   for (( expr1 ; expr2 ; expr1 ) ; do commands : done
            -   Way to do stuff to the results of different things, interesting

16. 3.2.4.2 Conditional Constructs

        ID: 5789B914-E9C5-49C2-998B-86956C3E47CF

    -   if
        -   looks like
            -   if test ; then
                -   do stuff
            -   elif test ; then
                -   do more stuff
            -   else more stuff;
            -   fi
    -   case
        -   looks like
            -   case word in [ [(] pattern [&ldquo; pattern]&#x2026;) command-list ;;]&#x2026; esac
        -   Can ignore case with a flag
        -   A clause is a list of patterns and commands for them
        -   Clause words undergo expansion before execution
        -   Idiom is to use `*` as the final pattern so something runs
        -   Nice example to get into the mindset

            ```shell
            echo -n "Enter the name of an animal: "
            read ANIMAL
            echo -n "The $ANIMAL has "
            case $ANIMAL in
                horse | dog | cat) echo -n "four";;
                man | kangaroo ) echo -n "two";;
                *) echo -n "an unknown number of";;
            esac
            echo " legs."
            ```
        -   `;;` short-circuits
        -   `;&` continues execution after a clause match
        -   `;;&` test the next clause
    -   select
        -   Generate menus and commands to do stuff with them, wow
        -   Example to choose files from a directory

            ```shell
            select fname in *;
            do
                echo you picked $fname \($REPLY\)
                break;
            done
            ```
    -   ((&#x2026;))
        -   Evaluate an expression
        -   Braces
    -   Two left brackets &#x2026; two right brackets
        -   Bash conditional expression construct
        -   Word splittin and filename expansion not performed
        -   Every other expansion is performed
        -   In string equality checks, the contents in double quotes are expanded
        -   Can also match strings on regexen using =~
        -   This section will be re-read many times it contains critical aspects of how
            pattern matching works here
        -   Tip: declare regex patterns as a variable to easily use them in a check

17. 3.2.4.3 Grouping Commands

    -   Group commands for execution as a unit
    -   Redirections are performed for the unit
    -   ()
        -   Execute commands in a subshell
    -   {}
        -   Execute commands in the current shell
        -   Ends with a semi-colon

20. 3.3 Shell Functions

        ID: 2BE4DE12-5908-45F5-AE10-95053B5B2B78

    -   They are functions
    -   Executed within the current shell
    -   Don&rsquo;t have to declare with &rsquo;function&rsquo;
    -   Lot of optional syntax
        -   () optional if you use function
        -   {} optional in the declaration
    -   Posix mode forbids renaming builtin functions; reason enough to always run in
        posix mode
    -   Your command list either has to end with a newline before the bracket or if
        the bracket is on the same line then end with a semicolon
    -   `#` is the number of parms
    -   `FUNCNAME` is the function executing
    -   Otherwise everything else is the same being in the same shell
    -   `local` declares function local variables
        -   Kind of a big deal to know
    -   Great debugging support, function name and file location
    -   Recursive functions allowed

    -   Probably a key section for utilizing job control

24. 3.5 Shell Expansions

        ID: 52CE0107-E6A5-4A95-9D2C-058C8770FCF3

    -   These sections might be key to a lot of &ldquo;simple&rdquo; Bash stuff
    -   Order-of-expansion provided
    -   Some systems also have *process substitution*
    -   Expansion is first-class macro expansion, some generating more words, some
        generating one word

25. 3.5.1 Brace Expansion

        ID: 46F26A26-779A-4BCA-BF4B-145D2BC1E0E4

    -   **Purpose:** generate arbitrary strings
    -   **A brace is a squiggly-paren**
    -   Haven&rsquo;t read a document like this since the Scheme days
        -   Precise, details, dense
        -   Full range of expressivity, included with GNU and everything else, why don&rsquo;t
            we learn this instead of using Python? Perhaps because of a higher barrier
            to entry?
    -   Can perform on sequences; results replacing orginal expression
    -   Is **strictly textual**
    -   Specify things to expand either as ranges, or individaul values separated by
        commas
    -   Examples
        -   Make multiple subdirectories
        -   Change ownership of multiple files, matched by regex
            -   Need to internalize this idea, of what to do, to what&#x2026; the &ldquo;to what&rdquo;
                part&#x2026; expansion

26. 3.5.2 Tilde Expansion

    -   Optionally enclosed by braches (squiggly paren)
    -   Form: ${parm}
        -   Parm is
            -   Substituted
            -   Can be a shell parm
            -   Can be an array references
    -   `!` as first arg used for *indirect expansion* which lets you expand to create
        variable references that are then de-referenced to get the value
        -   Lispy
    -   Lots of conditional logic operators to help manage the usage and setting of
        parameters in conditions of null-ness, or not, and how to handle it
        -   Ruby has that idiom: val = this || do something guaranteed not null and
            it is that kind of stuff here
    -   Trying to internalize this stuff with the examples, same ideas everywhere
        -   Get a substring from a variable, in any direction, via any regex
    -   Can use a regex to get variables named with a name like
    -   Can get the length of values
    -   Powerful constructs abound; nearly overwhelmed
        -   Kind skimmed the last examples, wonder if I should have dug deep
        -   Would be nice to have a guide of only scenarios, or more examples, of when
            you sould use stuff like this
        -   Will revisit again, this seems important

28. 3.5.4 Command Substitution

        ID: E07A9AAC-9D8F-475A-9416-FF94A7746871

    -   Can appear in double quotes, without word splitting and filename expansion
    -   Not aliasing

29. 3.5.5 Arithmetic Expansion

        ID: 636157D8-9322-4D6F-B0C5-E96790117F17

    -   Does math: $(( expr ))

        used elsehwere

31. 3.5.7 Word Splitting

        ID: 5E5DB551-9359-41C3-83EE-258AFB2A1537

32. 3.5.8 Filename Expansion

        ID: 7FF4407B-1432-43E0-A065-445781D44E85

    -   Been using this forever, never knew

33. 3.5.8.1 Pattern Matching

        ID: 4960E2E8-13CB-4AC6-9EB8-FAC3F299E025

    -   Every character matches itself but for the following
    -   **`*`:** Match anything including NULL
        &#x2013; \*\* means something if `globstar` is set, match all files and zero or more
           directories and subdirectories
    -   **`?`:** single char
    -   **`[...]`:** Any one of he enclosed chars.
        -   Can match range expressions
        -   Posix class values also work eg `alpha` or `digit`
    -   You can match on list of patterns, with the typical matching: zoer or one,
        zero or more, one or more, one, and any of them

        ID: 54C3B01E-A205-48DA-B6AE-454C726F3C74

    -   `>` does it
    -   `noclobber` disabllows overwriting a file
        -   `>|` lets you stomp on it anyway
            -   Maybe always use this if that is the goal

38. 3.6.3 Appending Redirected Output

        ID: F21030A8-3B6E-448A-9975-AD6B9ABEA9F8

47. 3.7.1 Simple Command Expansion

        ID: C7C6C532-10BE-4435-BC5F-27D754FA1D2B

    -   Expansion flow is explained
        -   Variables and redirections are processed later
        -   Everything else is expanded
        -   Redirections are performed
        -   Text after `=` in assigments is expanded
    -   If no command name results, assignments affect current environment
        -   Otherwise variables are added to environment of the executed command and
            don&rsquo;t affect the current environment
        -   What?!
    -   The flow described here seems important
        -   Think it is saying that lines with only a set affect current environment,
            and that you can set a var on lines with a command so that the var is set
            in the environment where the command is run
            -   Is this the dynamic extent of the call or does it have to do with
                subshells?
    -   Wonder if I should read the next section on search and execution before
        posing questions here?

48. 3.7.2 Command Search and Execution

        ID: 2051F393-57FB-46AC-B7CE-AAA7CDE98214

    -   Commands without slashes are searched for and if there is a shell function it
        is run
    -   If it doesn&rsquo;t match a function then it is searched for in the builtins
    -   If those both fail it searches the `PATH` for an executable file with that name
        -   There is a variable, a cache of executable files used previously, and this
            `PATH` search only happens if the command isn&rsquo;t found in the cache
        -   There is a handler function if nothing is found
    -   &ldquo;If the search is successful, or if the command name contains one or more
        slashes, the shell executes the named program in a separate execution
        environment.&rdquo;
        -   What does it mean to run in a separate execution environment? Is that a new
            shell or not? Is that just the dynamic extent?
    -   Otherwise it is a shell script that it can run
    -   Whatever *it* is, is run

49. 3.7.3 Command Execution Environment

        ID: 702C1B14-4D7F-400A-B7F9-377F0EB5DC59

    -   The execution environment is
        -   Open files
        -   Current working directory
        -   File creation mode
        -   Traps
        -   Shell parms set by assignment or inherited
        -   Shell functions too
        -   Invoatin options
        -   `shopt` options
        -   aliases too
        -   process IDs, $$, and $PPID
    -   The execution environment of a simple command other than bultins or shell
        functions (like what?) inherits
        -   Just about all the same stuff
    -   Commands invoked in that separate environment cannot affect the shell&rsquo;s
        environment
    -   Commands subsititution occurs in a subshell environment
        -   By design, can&rsquo;t affect the calling shell&rsquo;s environment, good
    -   `&`&rsquo;ing a command when JC is off makes its output go to /dev/null
        -   Random tidbit or best place to note this?

50. 3.7.4 Environment

        ID: 8FB6D4F2-AB6A-4E66-AC35-67BA11FD66E6

    -   Represented by name-value pairs

51. 3.7.5 Exit Status

        ID: A93E2F33-3C7A-4E40-9649-0BDDF34C63E8

    -   Rationale for error codes
    -   Some examples
        -   **2:** incorrect usage

52. 3.7.6 Signals

        ID: ADE7A273-D93B-47A9-8D37-8102722580F4

    -   Details overview of what signals Bash ignores and when
    -   Should configure my Bash system with `shopt`
    -   Should study well known signals listed here
        -   `man signal` has a nice list on the 2nd page already
    -   Important coverage of how async calls are handled when signals are generated
        -   Because I don&rsquo;t understand it

53. 3.8 Shell Scripts

        ID: A28DFB40-F0A6-4745-AD92-C3F574890AE9

    -   Calling a shell script invokes a non-interactive shell
    -   Calling a shell script occurs in a subshell
        -   bash filename args
        -   filename args
            -   For executable bit files

4.  4.3.1 The Set Builtin

        ID: 9F2E52B6-DBAC-49A3-99B5-3758F96BFF03

    -   Documentations states that this command is complicated
    -   Display names in a format so you can re-set them
    -   Disable and enable filename globbing
    -   Read commands but don&rsquo;t execute them; validates syntax
    -   Set all of the available options by name
    -   Treat unset variables and parms as errors: nice!
    -   Maybe set `PS4` so it is obvious what is happening when `set -x`

    1.  Options

            ID: 27F1F7E4-E1BB-4E5F-B905-A8A60101678F

        -   `allexport`
            -   Same as -a.
            -   -a
                Mark variables and function which are modified or created for export to the environment of subsequent commands.
        -   `braceexpand`
            -   Same as -B.
            -   -B
                The shell will perform brace expansion (see Brace Expansion). This option is on by default.
        -   `emacs`
            -   Use an emacs-style line editing interface (see Command Line Editing). This also affects the editing interface used for read -e.
        -   `errexit`
            -   Same as -e.
            -   -e
                Exit immediately if a pipeline (see Pipelines), which may consist of a single simple command (see Simple Commands), a list (see Lists), or a compound command (see Compound Commands) returns a non-zero status. The shell does not exit if the command that fails is part of the command list immediately following a while or until keyword, part of the test in an if statement, part of any command executed in a && or || list except the command following the final && or ||, any command in a pipeline but the last, or if the command’s return status is being inverted with !. If a compound command other than a subshell returns a non-zero status because a command failed while -e was being ignored, the shell does not exit. A trap on ERR, if set, is executed before the shell exits.
                This option applies to the shell environment and each subshell environment separately (see Command Execution Environment), and may cause subshells to exit before executing all the commands in the subshell.
                If a compound command or shell function executes in a context where -e is being ignored, none of the commands executed within the compound command or function body will be affected by the -e setting, even if -e is set and a command returns a failure status. If a compound command or shell function sets -e while executing in a context where -e is ignored, that setting will not have any effect until the compound command or the command containing the function call completes.
        -   `errtrace`
            -   Same as -E.
            -   -E
                If set, any trap on ERR is inherited by shell functions, command substitutions, and commands executed in a subshell environment. The ERR trap is normally not inherited in such cases.
        -   `functrace`
            -   Same as -T.
            -   -T
            -   If set, any trap on DEBUG and RETURN are inherited by shell functions, command substitutions, and commands executed in a subshell environment. The DEBUG and RETURN traps are normally not inherited in such cases.
        -   `hashall`
            -   Same as -h.
            -   -h
            -   Locate and remember (hash) commands as they are looked up for execution. This option is enabled by default.
        -   `histexpand`
            -   Same as -H.
            -   -H
            -   Enable ‘!’ style history substitution (see History Interaction). This option is on by default for interactive shells.
        -   `history`
            -   Enable command history, as described in Bash History Facilities. This option is on by default in interactive shells.
        -   `ignoreeof`
            -   An interactive shell will not exit upon reading EOF.
        -   `keyword`
            -   Same as -k.
            -   -k
            -   All arguments in the form of assignment statements are placed in the environment for a command, not just those that precede the command name.
        -   `monitor`
            -   Same as -m.
            -   -m
            -   Job control is enabled (see Job Control). All processes run in a separate process group. When a background job completes, the shell prints a line containing its exit status.
        -   `noclobber`
            -   Same as -C.
            -   -C
            -   Prevent output redirection using ‘>’, ‘>&’, and ‘<>’ from overwriting existing files.
        -   `noexec`
            -   Same as -n.
            -   -n
            -   Read commands but do not execute them; this may be used to check a script for syntax errors. This option is ignored by interactive shells.
        -   `noglob`
            -   Same as -f.
            -   -f
            -   Disable filename expansion (globbing).
        -   `nolog`
            -   Currently ignored.
        -   `notify`
            -   Same as -b.
            -   -b
            -   Cause the status of terminated background jobs to be reported immediately, rather than before printing the next primary prompt.
        -   `nounset`
            -   Same as -u.
            -   -u
            -   Treat unset variables and parameters other than the special parameters ‘@’ or ‘\*’ as an error when performing parameter expansion. An error message will be written to the standard error, and a non-interactive shell will exit.
        -   `onecmd`
            -   Same as -t.
            -   -t
            -   Exit after reading and executing one command.
        -   `physical`
            -   Same as -P.
            -   -P
            -   If set, do not resolve symbolic links when performing commands such as cd which change the current directory. The physical directory is used instead. By default, Bash follows the logical chain of directories when performing commands which change the current directory.
                For example, if /usr/sys is a symbolic link to /usr/local/sys then:

                ```shell
                $ cd /usr/sys; echo $PWD
                /usr/sys
                $ cd ..; pwd
                /usr
                ```

                If set -P is on, then:

                ```shell
                $ cd /usr/sys; echo $PWD
                /usr/local/sys
                $ cd ..; pwd
                /usr/local
                ```
        -   `pipefail`
            -   If set, the return value of a pipeline is the value of the last (rightmost) command to exit with a non-zero status, or zero if all commands in the pipeline exit successfully. This option is disabled by default.
        -   `posix`
            -   Change the behavior of Bash where the default operation differs from the POSIX standard to match the standard (see Bash POSIX Mode). This is intended to make Bash behave as a strict superset of that standard.
        -   `privileged`
            -   Same as -p.
            -   -p
            -   Turn on privileged mode. In this mode, the $BASH<sub>ENV</sub> and $ENV files are not processed, shell functions are not inherited from the environment, and the SHELLOPTS, BASHOPTS, CDPATH and GLOBIGNORE variables, if they appear in the environment, are ignored. If the shell is started with the effective user (group) id not equal to the real user (group) id, and the -p option is not supplied, these actions are taken and the effective user id is set to the real user id. If the -p option is supplied at startup, the effective user id is not reset. Turning this option off causes the effective user and group ids to be set to the real user and group ids.
        -   `verbose`
            -   Same as -v.
            -   -v
            -   Print shell input lines as they are read.
        -   `vi`
            -   Use a vi-style line editing interface. This also affects the editing interface used for read -e.
        -   `xtrace`
            -   Same as -x.
            -   -x
            -   Print a trace of simple commands, for commands, case commands, select commands, and arithmetic for commands and their arguments or associated word lists after they are expanded and before they are executed. The value of the PS4 variable is expanded and the resultant value is printed before the command and its expanded arguments.

5.  4.3.2 The Shopt Builtin

        ID: C48D4C30-AA29-4122-B878-2D2D19D1CB0E

    -   Change more shell behavior
    -   Going to have lots of good stuff set; so powerful
        -   Case in point: `autocd`, sheesh yes!!!
    -   Others: handling directory name spelling, bash version compatibility, `dotglob`,
        `extdbug` (what debuggers?), `gnu_errfmt`, `no_empty_cmd_completion`
    -   Why did it take so long to learn Bash?

    1.  Options

            ID: 98784542-1E2F-421F-AC9C-4DB8E2AC0A45

        -   `autocd`
            -   If set, a command name that is the name of a directory is executed as if it were the argument to the cd command. This option is only used by interactive shells.
        -   `cdable_vars`
            -   If this is set, an argument to the cd builtin command that is not a directory is assumed to be the name of a variable whose value is the directory to change to.
        -   `cdspell`
            -   If set, minor errors in the spelling of a directory component in a cd command will be corrected. The errors checked for are transposed characters, a missing character, and a character too many. If a correction is found, the corrected path is printed, and the command proceeds. This option is only used by interactive shells.
        -   `checkhash`
            -   If this is set, Bash checks that a command found in the hash table exists before trying to execute it. If a hashed command no longer exists, a normal path search is performed.
        -   `checkjobs`
            -   If set, Bash lists the status of any stopped and running jobs before exiting an interactive shell. If any jobs are running, this causes the exit to be deferred until a second exit is attempted without an intervening command (see Job Control). The shell always postpones exiting if any jobs are stopped.
        -   `checkwinsize`
            -   If set, Bash checks the window size after each command and, if necessary, updates the values of LINES and COLUMNS.
        -   `cmdhist`
            -   If set, Bash attempts to save all lines of a multiple-line command in the same history entry. This allows easy re-editing of multi-line commands.
        -   `compat31`
            -   If set, Bash changes its behavior to that of version 3.1 with respect to quoted arguments to the conditional command’s ‘=~’ operator and with respect to locale-specific string comparison when using the [[ conditional command’s ‘<’ and ‘>’ operators. Bash versions prior to bash-4.1 use ASCII collation and strcmp(3); bash-4.1 and later use the current locale’s collation sequence and strcoll(3).
        -   `compat32`
            -   If set, Bash changes its behavior to that of version 3.2 with respect to locale-specific string comparison when using the [[ conditional command’s ‘<’ and ‘>’ operators (see previous item).
        -   `compat40`
            -   If set, Bash changes its behavior to that of version 4.0 with respect to locale-specific string comparison when using the [[ conditional command’s ‘<’ and ‘>’ operators (see description of compat31) and the effect of interrupting a command list. Bash versions 4.0 and later interrupt the list as if the shell received the interrupt; previous versions continue with the next command in the list.
        -   `compat41`
            -   If set, Bash, when in POSIX mode, treats a single quote in a double-quoted parameter expansion as a special character. The single quotes must match (an even number) and the characters between the single quotes are considered quoted. This is the behavior of POSIX mode through version 4.1. The default Bash behavior remains as in previous versions.
        -   `compat42`
            -   If set, Bash does not process the replacement string in the pattern substitution word expansion using quote removal.
        -   `complete_fullquote`
            -   If set, Bash quotes all shell metacharacters in filenames and directory names when performing completion. If not set, Bash removes metacharacters such as the dollar sign from the set of characters that will be quoted in completed filenames when these metacharacters appear in shell variable references in words to be completed. This means that dollar signs in variable names that expand to directories will not be quoted; however, any dollar signs appearing in filenames will not be quoted, either. This is active only when bash is using backslashes to quote completed filenames. This variable is set by default, which is the default Bash behavior in versions through 4.2.
        -   `direxpand`
            -   If set, Bash replaces directory names with the results of word expansion when performing filename completion. This changes the contents of the readline editing buffer. If not set, Bash attempts to preserve what the user typed.
        -   `dirspell`
            -   If set, Bash attempts spelling correction on directory names during word completion if the directory name initially supplied does not exist.
        -   `dotglob`
            -   If set, Bash includes filenames beginning with a ‘.’ in the results of filename expansion.
        -   `execfail`
            -   If this is set, a non-interactive shell will not exit if it cannot execute the file specified as an argument to the exec builtin command. An interactive shell does not exit if exec fails.
        -   `expand_aliases`
            -   If set, aliases are expanded as described below under Aliases, Aliases. This option is enabled by default for interactive shells.
        -   `extdebug`
            -   If set, behavior intended for use by debuggers is enabled:
                -   The -F option to the declare builtin (see Bash Builtins) displays the source file name and line number corresponding to each function name supplied as an argument.
                -   If the command run by the DEBUG trap returns a non-zero value, the next command is skipped and not executed.
                -   If the command run by the DEBUG trap returns a value of 2, and the shell is executing in a subroutine (a shell function or a shell script executed by the . or source builtins), a call to return is simulated.
                -   BASH<sub>ARGC</sub> and BASH<sub>ARGV</sub> are updated as described in their descriptions (see Bash Variables).
                -   Function tracing is enabled: command substitution, shell functions, and subshells invoked with ( command ) inherit the DEBUG and RETURN traps.
                -   Error tracing is enabled: command substitution, shell functions, and subshells invoked with ( command ) inherit the ERR trap.
        -   `extglob`
            -   If set, the extended pattern matching features described above (see Pattern Matching) are enabled.
        -   `extquote`
            -   If set, $&rsquo;string&rsquo; and $&ldquo;string&rdquo; quoting is performed within ${parameter} expansions enclosed in double quotes. This option is enabled by default.
        -   `failglob`
            -   If set, patterns which fail to match filenames during filename expansion result in an expansion error.
        -   `force_fignore`
            -   If set, the suffixes specified by the FIGNORE shell variable cause words to be ignored when performing word completion even if the ignored words are the only possible completions. See Bash Variables, for a description of FIGNORE. This option is enabled by default.
        -   `globasciiranges`
            -   If set, range expressions used in pattern matching bracket expressions (see Pattern Matching) behave as if in the traditional C locale when performing comparisons. That is, the current locale’s collating sequence is not taken into account, so ‘b’ will not collate between ‘A’ and ‘B’, and upper-case and lower-case ASCII characters will collate together.
        -   `globstar`
            -   If set, the pattern ‘\*\*’ used in a filename expansion context will match all files and zero or more directories and subdirectories. If the pattern is followed by a ‘/’, only directories and subdirectories match.
        -   `gnu_errfmt`
            -   If set, shell error messages are written in the standard GNU error message format.
        -   `histappend`
            -   If set, the history list is appended to the file named by the value of the HISTFILE variable when the shell exits, rather than overwriting the file.
        -   `histreedit`
            -   If set, and Readline is being used, a user is given the opportunity to re-edit a failed history substitution.
        -   `histverify`
            -   If set, and Readline is being used, the results of history substitution are not immediately passed to the shell parser. Instead, the resulting line is loaded into the Readline editing buffer, allowing further modification.
        -   `hostcomplete`
            -   If set, and Readline is being used, Bash will attempt to perform hostname completion when a word containing a ‘@’ is being completed (see Commands For Completion). This option is enabled by default.
        -   `huponexit`
            -   If set, Bash will send SIGHUP to all jobs when an interactive login shell exits (see Signals).
        -   `interactive_comments`
            -   Allow a word beginning with ‘#’ to cause that word and all remaining characters on that line to be ignored in an interactive shell. This option is enabled by default.
        -   `lastpipe`
            -   If set, and job control is not active, the shell runs the last command of a pipeline not executed in the background in the current shell environment.
        -   `lithist`
            -   If enabled, and the cmdhist option is enabled, multi-line commands are saved to the history with embedded newlines rather than using semicolon separators where possible.
        -   `login_shell`
            -   The shell sets this option if it is started as a login shell (see Invoking Bash). The value may not be changed.
        -   `mailwarn`
            -   If set, and a file that Bash is checking for mail has been accessed since the last time it was checked, the message &ldquo;The mail in mailfile has been read&rdquo; is displayed.
        -   `no_empty_cmd_completion`
            -   If set, and Readline is being used, Bash will not attempt to search the PATH for possible completions when completion is attempted on an empty line.
        -   `nocaseglob`
            -   If set, Bash matches filenames in a case-insensitive fashion when performing filename expansion.
        -   `nocasematch`
            -   If set, Bash matches patterns in a case-insensitive fashion when performing matching while executing case or [[ conditional commands.
        -   `nullglob`
            -   If set, Bash allows filename patterns which match no files to expand to a null string, rather than themselves.
        -   `progcomp`
            -   If set, the programmable completion facilities (see Programmable Completion) are enabled. This option is enabled by default.
        -   `promptvars`
            -   If set, prompt strings undergo parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal after being expanded as described below (see Controlling the Prompt). This option is enabled by default.
        -   `restricted_shell`
            -   The shell sets this option if it is started in restricted mode (see The Restricted Shell). The value may not be changed. This is not reset when the startup files are executed, allowing the startup files to discover whether or not a shell is restricted.
        -   `shift_verbose`
            -   If this is set, the shift builtin prints an error message when the shift count exceeds the number of positional parameters.
        -   `sourcepath`
            -   If set, the source builtin uses the value of PATH to find the directory containing the file supplied as an argument. This option is enabled by default.
        -   `xpg_echo`
            -   If set, the echo builtin expands backslash-escape sequences by default.

### 6 Bash Features

    ID: F921F61C-183E-4C87-91A2-210130B18B2B

-   No comment

1.  6.1 Invoking Bash

        ID: FF94CBB8-569C-41E2-B031-CD16730C45CD

    -   Lots of interactive startup config commands
    -   Some you can&rsquo;t do with `getopts`
    -   `--noprofile` good for debugging, `--norc` too

2.  6.2 Bash Startup Files

        ID: 931D2B7D-2568-4217-9B12-2809E1FCCD99

    -   Invoked as an interactive login shell, or with &#x2013;login
        -   Read `/etc/profile` and execute
        -   Read and execute first one that exists and is readable
            -   `~/.bash_profile`
            -   `~/.bash_login`
            -   `~/.profile`
        -   On exit, read and run `~/.bash_logout` if it exists.
    -   Invoked as an interactive non-login shell
        -   Read and execute `~/.bashrc`, if that file exists
            -   &ldquo;So, typically, your ~/.bash<sub>profile</sub> contains the line&rdquo;

                ```shell
                if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then . ~/.bashrc; fi after (or before) any login-specific
                initializations.
                ```
        -   Seems like separating interactive and non-interactive features goes in those
            places
    -   Invoked non-interactively
        -   Uses `BASH_ENV` to execute the file

    -   Invoked with name sh
        -   Mimic `sh` startup behavior
        -   Auto-enter Posix mode
        -   Never use this
    -   Invoked in POSIX mode
        -   Follow Posix standard for startup files
    -   Invoked by remote shell daemon
        -   Use ~/.bashrc
    -   Invoked with unequal effective and real UID/GIDs
        -   Don&rsquo;t read anything

    -   sigint ignored without traps
    -   sighup sent if configured
    -   Ignore -n

9.  6.6 Aliases

        ID: D418A98E-DD17-453A-A752-6949795831BA

    -   String substitution of aliases when used as first word of simple command
    -   Recursive alias expansion is not allowed; so ls/ls -al works without an
        infinite loop
    -   Only expanded in inteactive mode!
        -   Unless shopt `expand_aliases`
        -   Should do this, more predictable
    -   &ldquo;To be safe
        -   always put alias definitions on a separate line
        -   and do not use alias in compound command&ldquo;
    -   &ldquo;For almost every purpose, shell functions are preferred over aliases.&rdquo;
        -   Obvious good purpose is command defs

            -   Zero-based
        -   Associative
            -   Using strings
    -   Declaring is better, can declare by using too
    -   Compound assignment: name=(val1 val2 val3)
        -   val is: 0=foo
    -   Array reference: ${name[subscript]}
        -   When subscript is @ or \*, expand to all members
            -   Behavior diffs in
                -   Double quotes, \*: single word with all values
                -   Double quotes, @: separate words
    -   &ldquo; ${!name[@]} and ${!name[\*]} expand to the indices assigned in array
        variable name. &rdquo;
    -   `unset` destroys arrays and their contents, individually
    -   `read` right into an array

# Making Sense of this Script

    ID: 886036D5-3715-492B-9ABF-825F4058A995

## Desires

    ID: C1CA8CCE-D299-4034-8ACA-432622B38640

-   Things that I want to do with Bash, and how I want to do them
    -   Understand the computer and its operating system
        -   Explore the contents of the disk drive and memory
    -   Automated tedious and error prone tasks as quickly as possible
        -   Develop shell scripts to do so
        -   Leverage multi-tasking
    -   Maximize expressivity and predictability
        -   Maximize predictability
        -   Minimize surprise
        -   Fail fast

## Approach to Learning and Configuring Bash

    ID: 9C4ED82B-B909-4546-9AA4-EC1877223C8D

-   Bash provides a rich and complicated configuration facility
-   Successfully solving problems with Bash requires that you (goal)
    -   Understand what it can do
    -   Configure it to do so in a way that you prefer
-   Working with Bash provides the results by recognizing that you attain practice
    and experience (means)
    -   Understanding possibilities requires study and practice (practice)
    -   Configuring requires experience and personal-preference (experience)
-   The purpose of this document is to capture both the means and the goal

## The Purpose of Bash

    ID: 20275946-BE34-4DC6-B9B1-A5944F23B899

-   The `set` builtin
    <sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
    onerously states that "This builtin is so complicated that it deserves its own
    section". That can be off-putting for the new-operator (or programmer). The
    word *complicated* is more like a code-word here though; it is really a short
    hand for *expressivity*. `set` lets you configure the system (Bash) any way you
    choose; it fully enables you to express your personal definition of
    expressivity when it comes to system management. This is no small feat. Doing
    so belies the complexity, magnitude, and power lurking behind the thin veneer
    that most only know as &ldquo;the powerful command line interface&rdquo; that most only
    use to start graphical user interface applications. Bash is the most humble
    servant; expertly negotiation with the kernel, humbly taking orders from the
    operator, and deftly managing the work of any number of processes.
    Forgive my anthropomorphization; we may ever know someone like Bash in our own
    lives for that is truly a rare and kind soul.

## Understanding Your Cognitive Landscape

    ID: 435374DD-FDEA-4D0A-B5C2-5E205B30B04F

-   Doing things with Bash
    -   It is difficult to make sense of all of the configuration options for doing
        things with Bash
    -   When you&rsquo;ve got experience, rely on that
    -   When you haven&rsquo;t got experience, document your intent and obtain experience
    -   Both the things that you do with Bash and the thing that you *want to* do with
        Bash are your personal cognitive landscape that guide the configuration
-   Roles of Doers
    -   My goal is to classify configuration options by roles that have different
        goals. Some of the roles have overlap in the goals, some don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t
        know yet what are the best role definitions or how options overlap. I will
        find out and document it here. *Doers* is the name of someone or something
        executing things with an intent. My goal is to reveal intent and use that
        for classification and role definition.
    -   Broad Doer definitions
        -   Interactive vs Non-Interactive Shell
            -   Interactive: requires input from the user
            -   Non-Interactive: doesn&rsquo;t
            -   Unsure how to use this to classify configuration because most scripts
                are in a `tty` and you *can* accept input. Should you? Is that the question?
                What does it mean to configure Bash, and for what? Here is an attempt:
                -   Interactive is for configuring things that you only ever want to do
                    or care about as a human sitting at a terminal. These are things that
                    I will pretend/decide that I will never every do when running a
                    non-interactive script. This whole plan relies on strictly separating
                    implementation of both kinds of scripts
                -   Non-interactive is for things that I as a human will never see. Or
                    perhaps things that I don&rsquo;t care to see immediately because I didn&rsquo;t
                    run them. The overlap is so close here. Perhaps &ldquo;things that I want
                    to see&rdquo; and &ldquo;things that I want to do interactively&rdquo; is the correct
                    classifier.
                -   This is a design choice
        -   Login and Non-Login Shell
            -   Are you initiating things or is a `cron`?
            -   This is a system/user choice
                -   You choose to use the system; executing things via a Login shell
                -   You schedule things for the system to do; executing things via a
                    Non-Login shell
-   Classifying things Bash can do
    -   Not using tags to classify because they won&rsquo;t reflect document structure and
        I&rsquo;m not sure where to begin
    -   Tried using multiple tags and that confused the whole effort
    -   Switched to one tag
        -   Every time I feel like using multiple tags, I will try to update the
            Desires to make sense of what I value

## Observations & Questions & Decisions

    ID: 3D8CB422-87BC-47A8-BA42-8D4A0AFEF99E

### Version 01

    ID: F1878DC4-317A-4743-90D0-DFF6971E58FB

-   The login interactive shell is for things that you will only do at the
    start and finish of a logical session
    -   Attached to your ID and a `tty` owned by you
    -   Not much work to do here
-   The login non-interactive shell is for things that you will do every time
    that you begin another shell during a logical session
    -   This includes the login interactive shell, execute this as suggested by
        the Bash reference manual
-   The non-login non-interactive shell
    -   Is non-interactive because you have no way of interacting with it unless
        you hack some way to do so
    -   Non-Interactive is somewhat a misnomer here because you can choose to
        implement non-interactive scripts when a `tty` is attached but when you
        haven&rsquo;t got a `tty` attached there is no possibility of running interactive
        scripts
    -   Is non-login because it is not associated with your ID and at the same
        time not attached to a `tty` attached to you
    -   This document won&rsquo;t address non-login shells
        -   If you develop your scripts in a richly configured Bash environment, you
            will have to configure non-login shells to use the same environment. I am
            avoiding this topic because I need to see where this experiment goes.
        -   That was a mistake. After developing a powerful Bash environment you are
            likely to want to use that same environment for non-login shells. Of
            course you are!

### Version 02

    ID: E1339F20-FAF2-4E46-AFF1-DCB5811F80BE

-   Configure Bash for every user?
    -   Login Interactive and Non-Login Interactive are easy and obvious
    -   Non-Login Non-Interactive seems valuable but is less obvious
-   Bash vs Dash
    -   Performance reasons?
    -   [Via](https://www.wikivs.com/wiki/Bash_vs_dash)

        > Dash (Debian Almquist SHell) is a shell that has poor usability by modern standards when used as an interactive log-in shell, but is faster in executing POSIX-compliant scripts than Bash.
        > Bash (Bourne Again SHell) has many more features and is especially preferable when used interactively (although it does contain more programming features too).
        > Bash is typically provided as the default interactive shell, while Debian and Debian-derivatives like Ubuntu provide Dash as the /bin/sh implementation, thereby causing scripts with #!/bin/sh shebangs to be interpreted by Dash rather than Bash by default. For scripts that require Bash for execution, Bash will still be used as the interpreter if the shebang is #!/bin/bash.
        > Bash is designed for human beings and provides a superset of POSIX functionality
        > Supports the same scripting commands as Dash as well as its own additional commands (sometimes called &ldquo;Bashisms&rdquo;)
        > Supports tab completion
        > Supports a command history
        > Dash is for non-interactive script execution
        > Only supports POSIX compliant features
        > Small binary size (Dash is only 100K compared to Bash&rsquo;s 900K)
        > Faster start-up and script execution

        -   This provokes more questions
            -   Why have programming expressivity for DevOps and System Administration
                if you can&rsquo;t or shouldn&rsquo;t use it for startup scripts?

    -   Call it for the user with `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
-   Bash is for interactive tasks; Dash is for non-interactive tasks
-   You don&rsquo;t need Readline in non-interactive mode

### Version 03

    ID: DDB77782-98C3-4F45-9CCA-3D17CBAC327F

-   Desires read like
    -   Things that you would do as a software engineer
    -   Things that you would do as a devops engineer
-   Desire don&rsquo;t read like
    -   Things that you would do as scheduled task
    -   Things that you would do as a remotely executed task
-   This looks like a Bash system that
    -   Configures Bash for login shells and nothing more
-   Because
    -   Any further scope has no desires or experience to guide it
        -   Attempting to do anything more would result in aimless fruitless wandering
