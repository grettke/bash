- Search for learning resources
  - Googled "advanced bash", went through first two pages of results and
    selected "interesting" resources

      - Comprehensive nice looking contents

      that were novel or 2015+
    - Days later revised my search results to: Kindle, 4=stars+ on them and
       this one won with 5/5 stars of 20 reviews. I was looking for 2015
       or newest possible because I wanted Bash 4.2 covered; it added arrays.
       All years of books are probably valuable; I'm trying to save time by
       getting everything in one. Might be possible, might not; and I will try.
       The search results seem to include more than the criteria should have
       excluded.

          - 230/4.5. Looks great.
          - Good for beginners; I'm kind of a beginner wouldn't hurt to cover
            the stuff
        - D. [[http://www.amazon.com/Unix-Power-Tools-Shelley-Powers-ebook/dp/B0043EWUT8/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1453570490&sr=8-1-fkmr1&keywords=unix+scripting+pro+100][Unix Power Tools]]

          - Classic, wow
      - That got me thinking about asking the question
        - Do I want to learn Bash well? Do I want to learn scripting and system
          administration well? First, I want to learn Bash well, so I will focus
          on a Bash scripting book. This is for system admnistration in the form
          of DevOps, so I will pursue it in that order.
        - Is this realistic or possible? Starting to narrow it down. Thus far
          I've only read review and the title/cover. Reading the blurbs now.
          - +A :: real world, perfect.
          - +D :: mentions zsh, security, and more, didn't want a reference now,
               and this seems to have everything
          - +E :: Doesn't bloviate, all aspects, wow
          - -B :: seems like a great reference/introduction (refintroduction?)
               and not something I want given I want Bash stuff this also seems
               too introductory
          - -C :: mention Vi and deleting files, too basic
        - Down to 3: A, D, E
          - Only want one. Need to scope this somehow.
          - Never conidered how much I suck at sysadmin'ing, yikes I mean I can
            make it happen, not too badly, but I never read a single document
            on "being a sysadmin. Maybe it doesn't matter?
          - E is out, for the future, scope just too big
        - Down to 2: A, E
          - Review again
            - D :: Sysadmin stuff. Same as devops.
            - A :: says all the right things, develop a GUI with bash, but doesn't
                 get to Shell scripting until part 2 in chapter *11*, signal
                 handling is nice never touched that, advanced scipting doesn't
                 seem that advanced. Book has tone of sysadmin stuff, or if you
                 never used UNIX before. 3 chapters of example scripts that is
                 cool. First half of the book might skip.
          - Thoughts
            - Both are great books for different reasons
            - Perhaps I should get both?
            - Reviewed the TOCs again remembering the goal
              - A - Ch 1: overview. Everything else examples. Expect, can I use
                expect to answer prompts for stuff? I should learn Expect. Might
                not even need something like Monit if it is this simple. Sweet,
                sweet stuff.
              - B - Lookg introductory, but not, all useful stuff, might upt
                documentation together in mind
              - C - basics
              - D - shouldl ike it, but don't
                E - awesome, too much
            - Thoughts
              - Screwed up lettering, that was a bad idea
              - Both A and B look good, B leans more towards an overview thing,
                which is what I wanted in addition to the reference manual.
                I'll start there, bought it.
